# make-devtools

This is my repository for managing my development tools.

I use a Mac, but I don't use Homebrew much.
I build as much as I can myself because I want to minimize problems with the development environment.

When building, I set `--prefix=$HOME/.pkg` and add the `bin/` of each tool to `$PATH`.
